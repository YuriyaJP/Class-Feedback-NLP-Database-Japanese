Here I gather my data extracted from my students about their feelings from my English class.
The data is from 2023 and contains 120 entries.
I have tokenized it, removed words and classified the data into labels.



Description and goals: For this project I have collected qualitative data from 120 students whom I have taught English for 1 year during 2022-2023 at a public high school. The curriculum consisted of 4 big projects and students were asked to answer about their feelings on those projects such as the simplicity, ability to implement, usefulness and future recommendations for improvement. The questions and answers were completed in a Japanese language in an online Google form first and then stored as an Excel file.

The goal is to accumulate enough feedback and tailor the projects to students’ wishes and needs. I managed to identify the key problems for each project from its responses and refine best recommendations. Hopefully, this will help teachers listen to their students’ voices better and encourage them to collect more feedback due to the simplicity of its realisation.
